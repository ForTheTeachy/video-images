    <p>History of ancient Egypt. People settled in Egypt as early 
        as 6000 B.C. Over time, small villages joined together to
         become states until two kingdoms emerged: Lower Egypt, 
         which covers the Nile River Delta up to the Mediterranean 
         Sea in the north, and Upper Egypt, which covers the Nile Valley in the south.</p>
